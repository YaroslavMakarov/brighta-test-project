This calendar acts as a filter for applications that add files every day. And thanks to this filter, you can filter files at a certain interval.
To the left of the calendar is a set of standard filters. You can also manually select two dates between which you want to filter files.
Under the calendar, there are two buttons "Cancel" and "Refresh".
Clicking "Cancel" will reset all filters. The "Refresh" button is locked until one of the filters is selected or the filter is selected in manual mode. By clicking the "Refresh" button, you can request a server with a certain date range.
